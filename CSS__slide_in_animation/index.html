          Here you should hopefully see this content sliding into place.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you didn't see a sliding animation, then you're likely on some kind of browser that doesn't like:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Fun</li>
          <li>Standards</li>
          <li>The Internet</li>
          <li>You</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          I suggest upgrading to a nicer browser that will show
          you how neat the internet really can be.

            (not necessarily based on this demo alone.
            It's actually not that fun, if we're being totally
            honest here.)
